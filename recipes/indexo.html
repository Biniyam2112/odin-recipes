    <img src="image of Shiro Wot/shiro.PNG">
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">Shiro is an Ethiopian stew cooked using chickpeas or broad beans, garlic, onions, ginger, tomatoes, and chili peppers as the major components. <br>The chickpeas give this stew a great texture and nutty taste, but Shiro powder, which is a mixture of chickpea flour and different spices, can be used instead.</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 30px;">
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <li>One sliced onion</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>A half spoon of minced garlic</li>
        <li>Fresh tomato purée</li>
        <li>Shiro flour (chickpea flour)</li>
        <li>Fresh green chilly</li>
    </ul>
    <ol style="font-size: 30px;">
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <li> Turn on the stove and start heating up the cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Add one sliced onion into the pot.</li>
        <li> Cook the onions until the color is brownish.</li>
        <li>Add a little bit of oil and a half spoon of minced garlic. Cook them for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add fresh tomato purée. Then cook the ingredients very well till the moisture is released.</li>
        <li>Prepare a bowl and add the Shiro flour (chickpea flour). Then add water and mix them well. You have to remember that the amount of Shiro flour and water depends on your need.</li>
        <li>Whisk the mixture into the cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients very well and cook for a few minutes. Let the mixture absorb the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>The sauce will absorb all the moisture and start thickening (drying out).</li>
        <li>Start adding water when the sauce is drying out (add a small amount of water then stir and do this again and again till you get the desired thickness/consistency). Remember that Shiro flour thickens as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce starts to thicken it will form bubbles and it may overflow, so check frequently. Don't forget to cover the lid partially so that you can avoid overflow.</li>
        <li>Once it has come to boil, reduce the heat cover the lid fully and let it simmer. Stir occasionally and continue simmering. The longer it simmers the deeper the flavor.</li>
        <li>You may top it with fresh green chilly (if you want).</li>
        <li>That's it. Congratulations you have made your first Shiro wot! You can start serving.</li>
